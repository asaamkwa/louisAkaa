                   <p>“I believe that education is the cornerstone for an individual’s success as a person and as a member of the global village contributing positively to social, economic, political, cultural and environmental development of the world at large. For me education through the IB way is the building block for scientific temperament, developing a sense of aesthetic for life’s diverse and colorful fabric, being able to take calculated risks and informed decisions as opposed to sitting on the fence, inculcating patience for change and having the strength to face uncertainty with equanimity. I also believe that education’s relevance in today’s world lies in balancing conceptual clarity, content specialism and skill development wherein our learners at aLphabet are encouraged to observe and study the link between their learning and real time applications and then use their thinking processes, logic and reasoning to transfer their classroom learning to real world applications. I aim for our learners at aLphabet to lead by example, provide original and informed thoughts and opinions and contribute positively to society with their entrepreneurial and leadership skills.”</p>
